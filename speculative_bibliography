  A programming system, permitting the user to think 100% that he is
  programming with flowchart symbols, is described. This description
  includes the TWO-D syntax, the user's view-point, the CRT-terminal
  output, the overall structure of the simply-designed programming
  system, the file structure used, some design decisions faced, and the
  flowchart of the supervisory program.

If we work every day as K–12 art + design teachers, arts coordinators, museum professionals, or university teacher educators, why should science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) matter? STEAM matters because we are more than just instructors of art and art education. While most of our students year in and year out will not become professional artists, we are nevertheless arguably the primary teachers of creativity our students will ever have throughout their education. Fundamentally, our job is to instigate and foster arts practice and design thinking as a means for individual learning, social responsibility, and creative problem solving—mediating ideas and materials toward meaningful and enduring solutions. The art studio is one of the very few spaces in school or society where widely divergent outcomes are encouraged and never-before-imagined design solutions are valued. As an acronym for educational imagination, STEAM promises the enhancement of divergent outcomes emerging from the art + design studio by immersing students in a diversity of knowledge bases across contributing domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Moreover, one of the best things about STEAM education is that you do not have to figure out how to invent the STEAM engine for innovation alone. Diverse collaborations and resources equip STEAM classrooms for locomotion.

Design used to be the seasoning you'd sprinkle on for taste; now it's the flour you need at the start of the recipe,” tweeted John Maeda (2015) Maeda, J. [johnmaeda]. (2015, April 14). Design used to be the seasoning you'd sprinkle on for taste; now it's the flour you need at the start of the recipe [Tweet]. Retrieved from https://twitter.com/johnmaeda/status/588115995954442240  , former president of Rhode Island School of Design. One of his followers, Andy Jakubowski, replied, “@JohnSandel @johnmaeda don't you think design has always been the flour, it's just we started acknowledging that finally?” Consequently, there were 544 retweets and 463 favorites, including my own, of Maeda's initial tweet. For a moment across the twittersphere, Maeda's tweet captured a sentiment shared by many in the fields of art, education, business, and design. As art educators, we know that design is essential beyond the art classroom, although its fundamental application to student learning has largely been ignored.
