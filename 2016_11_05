we did not meet last week.

I suggested to Jeff, at some point after our last meeting, that Paul Rand's Thoughts On Design might be something he would want to read.

It would be fruitful to read Arnheim's essay on sketching and design from 1993.
Arnheim. Sketching and the Psychology of Design. Design Issues. 1993.
