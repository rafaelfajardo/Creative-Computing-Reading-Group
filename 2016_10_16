Rafael's reading notes:
Blackwell & Green. “Cognitive Dimensions of Notational Frameworks”. Notational Systems.

the authors note that Engineering has a tendency to design by checklist, that is to say, to formalize processes so that their outcomes are predictable and predictably good — according to whatever measurable goodness the context demands.

the authors further note that not all — in fact few other —  design disciplines follow this method. They instead “start in the middle” and explore.

they also note that the checklist approach is insufficient to create novel interfaces.

novel visual grammars are invoked

UI design is more craft than engineering

subject to affect, fashion, and social acceptance (MAYA principle, Chris Conley’s model of invention vs innovation)

worked example of speech-to-text system for Pascal. affordances of system did not match designers’ natural processes.

no language to describe the structure of the information (the program in Pascal in this instance)

the authors use viscosity as I would use the word inertia, 

premature commitment: constraints on the order of doing things in a process

to what degree do Programming Language Designers need to know about Semiotics?

page 5:
looks at the state of theory in visual programming environments, and the dearth of empirical usability studies. states they are good in some contexts and not in others.

every notation highlights some kinds of information at the cost of obscuring others. that is there is a bias , there is privilege

page 6:
Diagrams research summary.

cognitive dimension of Closeness of Mapping (similar to Borges On the exactitude of science. How close is the representation to the domain?)

cognitive dimension of Provisionality (degree of commitment to actions or marks)(see also Buxton’s definition of the properties of a Sketch in Sketching User Experiences: 
1.Bill Buxton. 2007. Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA.

)

Fitts's law (often cited as Fitts' law) is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/fitts-s-law-the-importance-of-size-and-distance-in-ui-design

argues that the Cognitive Dimensions framework is applicable early in the design process. Argues that Fitts’ Law and Hueristic Evaluation are only applicable much later in the process, at a higher level of finish or specification

argues usefulness with visual programming languages

(should there be a link in our conversation here to Scratch + Google and the distribution of their grammars?

typical user activity in visual programming is non-routine design

(routine versus non-routine in orthogonal relationship to routine vs non-routine as well)

page 7:
lists 6 types of notation use activity. not all are required.

components of Notational Systems
interaction language or notation
environment for editing (authoring)
medium of interaction 
(possibly) two kinds of sub-devices

page 8:
gives details about the components, or — rather — details the sub-components

Discussion notes:
Jeff and Chris shared their progress on remaking Maeda's programming language, Design By Numbers (DBN), in Racket, a programming language for writing programming languages. This task is congruent with our reading group values because it's an example of constructing an artifact in order to build understanding. Chris and Jeff want to examine decisions made by John Maeda -- and any of his collaborators -- in the design of the their language and editor. This means they are conducting a very close reading of both his book and of his API. They are -- in a manner of speaking -- reverse engineering DBN. They are -- also -- using a time-tested learning strategy in the visual arts; they are sitting before a (master) work and attempting to copy it, and, by so doing are finding both questions and insights. 

It was mentioned that Rafael is now listed as a member of a research group in Daniel Felix Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science. Now we need to strategize where to publish the work of this group.

CHI 2017 is located in Denver in May. CHI is the Special Insterest Group for Computer Human Interaction of the Association of Computing Machinery. The deadline for full papers has already passed, but the deadlines for New Work is in January, as is the deadline for Alt-CHI, a forum for transgressive thought in computer-human interaction. There is an Art program, but it hasn't published details yet.

Jeff would certainly like to publish at RacketCon, the conference for users/scholars of Racket.

Update: the Eyeo festival (pronounced eye oh, or IO) may be a place to disseminate within the domain of Creative Computation. Here are examples of a workshop hosted by Lauren McCarthy and Evelyn Eastmond that introduced the P5.JS project:

And an example of Evelyn Eastmond presenting Scratch to CHI Boston in 2009, where she discusses the design considerations and reveals that the first version of Scratch was built in SmallTalk. She also points to the genealogy or prior work that informed Scratch:

We talked about some peculiarities that Chris and Jeff have found with DBN. Chris was trying to make sense of the Dynamic Binding of values to variables in DBN. He showed an expression such that:

Set X 3
{
  Set X 5
  }
Print X

and asked Rafael what he thought the outcome would be.
Rafael said 5

and Jeff interjected a detail about the meaning of the { curly braces and what they signal }
which Rafael described as the creation and disappearance of a pocket universe inside the curly braces
so, Jeff continued, the outcome should be 3

But, Chris said, DBN said 5.
Rafael suggested that a novice programmer may have an easier time following the sequence of instructions that disregards the history of other computer languages and their uses of curly braces.

Another ideosyncracy that Jeff has been trying to tease out is the networked name space available in DBN
Rafael tried out the metaphor of Dropbox (the cloud-based file sharing tool) to understand the way it seems to work
Chris mentioned that he would like to talk to artists to see how they might use a construct of this kind
Rafael spun out a scenario using networked Raspberry Pi's and a garden simulation with bees visiting each potted plant (raspberry pi) and their location being handed off via a shared set of files or values at these network addresses.

We moved on to discuss pages 1-7 of the reading
Jeff pointed out the outline of the Cognitive Dimensions on Page 7
Rafael pointed to a possible critique with to respect to "what constitutes a SUB device"
Jeff had some questions that were answered on page 7

We discussed what we might want to read next.
We discussed genealogy of some projects and programming languages.

We discussed venue choices for Global Game Jam, which is being organized by Computer Science, but which may need a space.
We discussed architectural optimization for the HTC Vive, which both EDP and CS have. Chris had observed that a way to hang the headset cable on the ceiling would have been useful. Rafael remarked that EDP had done just that in the Hypercube.
